## Files
- mario-less.c, mario-more.c (dev copies)
- cash.c, credit.c
- mario-less/mario.c, mario-more/mario.c, cash/cash.c, credit/credit.c (submission copies with expected filenames)

## Submit with submit50 (from CS50.dev)
Run each from its folder so submit50 sees the expected filename:
- cd pset1-c/mario-less; submit50 cs50/problems/2025/x/mario/less
- cd pset1-c/mario-more; submit50 cs50/problems/2025/x/mario/more
- cd pset1-c/cash; submit50 cs50/problems/2025/x/cash
- cd pset1-c/credit; submit50 cs50/problems/2025/x/credit

If your course year uses a different slug (e.g., 2024/x), use that instead (check the pset page). Login with GitHub when prompted; submit50 stores your submission in a private GitHub repo and with the course grader.

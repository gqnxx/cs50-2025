# CS50 2025 — Problem Sets Workspace

This repository is organized for working through CS50’s problem sets up to the final project.

## Structure
- pset0-scratch — Scratch project(s). Your existing `Catch the Apple.sb3` is currently at repo root; we’ll keep it there and reference it here for now.
- pset1-c — C problems (Mario, Cash, Credit).
- More pset folders will be added as we proceed (pset2-arrays, pset3-algorithms, …).

## Checklist (living)
- [x] Pset0 — Scratch: Catch the Apple (`Catch the Apple.sb3` at repo root)
- [ ] Pset1 — C
  - [x] Mario (more)
  - [x] Cash
  - [x] Credit
- [ ] Pset2 — Arrays (C)
- [ ] Pset3 — Algorithms (C)
- [ ] Pset4 — Memory (C)
- [ ] Pset5 — Data Structures (C)
- [ ] Pset6 — Python
- [ ] Pset7 — SQL
- [ ] Pset8 — HTML, CSS, JavaScript

> Note: Exact problem names can vary slightly by year. We’ll adjust as we sync requirements for your cohort. For now, pset1 is scaffolded and implemented.

## How to build/run pset1 locally (optional)
If you have CS50 Library available (cs50.h), you can compile with `make`. Otherwise, compile with a standard C compiler.

## Submitting
We’ll commit each pset in its folder and push here. If you submit to CS50’s grader, you can copy files from the corresponding folder or push from CS50 IDE as required by the course.
